# corona_update

I was bored due to corona quarantine, and as i'm a lazy person i find it hard to go separet news portal everytiem . 
So i made django app which will fetch Corona related news form some news portal. It also fetch data from 
[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus] to get the current Corona update .

The app fetch news with every 5 mins interval , update information about corona virus with every 3 mins interval .I use 
apscheduler for scheduling the task .
